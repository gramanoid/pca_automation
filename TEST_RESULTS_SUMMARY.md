## Unit Test Results ⚠️

### Issue Identified:
The existing unit tests (`test_edge_cases.py` and `test_validation_suite.py`) are looking for modules that don't exist in the current project structure:
- Missing module: `verify_combined`
- Missing module: `main_scripts`

### Recommendation:
These tests need to be updated to match the current project structure where the main code is in `production_workflow/` directory.

## Test Infrastructure Setup ✅

### Successfully Installed:
1. **E2E Testing Framework**:
   - Playwright 1.52.0
   - Chromium browser drivers

2. **Unit Testing Framework**:
   - pytest 8.4.0
   - pytest-cov 6.1.1
   - pytest-mock 3.14.1
   - pytest-timeout 2.4.0
   - pytest-xdist 3.7.0

3. **Application Dependencies**:
   - All required dependencies for running the Streamlit application
   - All dependencies for the production workflow

## Screenshots Generated:
- 4 screenshots saved in `test_screenshots/` directory
- Screenshots show successful test execution with the application interface

## Overall Assessment:

✅ **E2E Tests**: Fully functional and passing
⚠️ **Unit Tests**: Need refactoring to match current project structure
✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Properly set up and ready for use
✅ **Application**: Running correctly and responding to test interactions

## Next Steps:

1. **Refactor Unit Tests**: Update import statements in unit tests to match the current project structure
2. **Add More E2E Scenarios**: Consider adding tests for:
   - Multiple file uploads
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Different file formats
   - Validation of output files
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
4. **Performance Testing**: Add tests to measure processing time for large files
