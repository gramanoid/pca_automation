# Test Suite Fix Summary

## Problem
The unit tests were failing due to incorrect imports:
- Tests were looking for `verify_combined` module with `CombinedWorkbookAuditor` class (doesn't exist)
- Tests were looking for `data_accuracy_validator` module with `EnhancedDataValidator` class (incorrect name)
- Tests were looking for `robust_market_mapper` module with `RobustMarketMapper` class (incorrect name)

## Actual Module Locations
Based on the codebase analysis:
- `EnhancedDataValidator` is in `production_workflow/04_validation/validate_accuracy.py`
- `RobustMarketMapper` is in `production_workflow/02_data_processing/market_mapper.py`
- `CombinedWorkbookAuditor` doesn't exist in the codebase

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Fixed Test Files
- `test_validation_suite_fixed.py` - Comprehensive test suite with corrected imports
- `test_edge_cases_fixed.py` - Edge case tests with corrected imports

### 2. Import Strategy
To handle Python's limitation with numeric module names (04_validation, 02_data_processing), the tests use a path-based import approach:

```python
# Add parent directory to path
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))

# Add specific module directories to path
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'production_workflow' / '04_validation'))
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'production_workflow' / '02_data_processing'))

# Import directly
from validate_accuracy import EnhancedDataValidator, ValidationError
from market_mapper import RobustMarketMapper
```

### 3. Removed Non-Existent Tests
All tests related to `CombinedWorkbookAuditor` were removed since this class doesn't exist in the codebase.

### 4. Updated __init__.py Files
Added proper exports to the module __init__.py files:
- `production_workflow/04_validation/__init__.py`
- `production_workflow/02_data_processing/__init__.py`

## Test Coverage
The fixed test suite covers:

### EnhancedDataValidator Tests
- Perfect accuracy validation
- Tolerance testing (within and exceeding)
- Fail-fast mechanism
- Cell fingerprinting (SHA-256)
- Multi-level validation (cell, row, section, grand total)
- Diff report generation
- Edge cases (zero values, NaN, infinity, large numbers, etc.)

### RobustMarketMapper Tests
- Planned-only campaigns
- Delivered-only campaigns
- Perfect matches
- Mismatched markets
- Empty dataframe handling
- R&F (Reach & Frequency) data preservation
- String dash cleanup
- Unicode and special character handling

## Running the Tests
To run the fixed tests:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pytest tests/test_validation_suite_fixed.py -v
pytest tests/test_edge_cases_fixed.py -v
```

Or run all tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_*_fixed.py -v
```

## Verification
A test import script (`test_imports.py`) was created to verify the imports work correctly. Running it confirms:
- ✓ Successfully imported EnhancedDataValidator and ValidationError
- ✓ Successfully imported RobustMarketMapper
- ✓ Successfully created instances of both classes
