# Simple LLM Mapper Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Date: May 28, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Row Offset Issue ✅
**Problem:** Data was appearing at row 16 instead of row 15
**Solution:** The template already had correct row numbers. The issue was the code overwriting template content.
**Status:** FIXED - Data now appears at correct rows

### 2. Platform Headers Overwriting ✅
**Problem:** Code was overwriting "DV360 TOTAL", "META TOTAL", etc. that already exist in template
**Solution:** Modified code to check if values exist before writing
**Status:** FIXED - Template content preserved

### 3. Platform Name in Column A ✅
**Problem:** Platform names (DV360, META, TIKTOK) were not appearing in column A
**Solution:** Added code to write platform name in column A when empty
**Status:** FIXED - Platform names now appear in A15, A52, A92

### 4. Platform Name Matching ✅
**Problem:** Code was looking for 'YOUTUBE' instead of 'DV360' in data
**Solution:** 
- Changed platform_structure key from 'YOUTUBE' to 'DV360'
- Added platform_aliases mapping to handle variations
- Updated platform matching logic to check all aliases
**Status:** FIXED - Now correctly matches DV360, META, TIKTOK and their variations

### 5. Market Column Structure ✅
**Problem:** Markets were being written to single columns instead of 2-column pairs
**Solution:** 
- Fixed column calculation to use 2-column structure (E:F, G:H, etc.)
- Added Planned/Actuals headers for each market in row 24
- Market names written to merged cells spanning 2 columns
**Status:** FIXED - Proper 2-column structure implemented

### 6. Data Aggregation Issues ⚠️
**Problem:** Actuals data showing as 0
**Solution Attempted:** 
- Added fallback to use UNIQUES_REACH from R&F data
- Added debug logging to identify data issues
**Finding:** The R&F data structure is different than expected:
- PLATFORM column contains metric names, not platform names
- No direct platform association for R&F data
- This is a data structure issue, not a code bug
**Status:** PARTIAL - Code handles available data correctly, but R&F data structure needs clarification

## Code Changes Made

### 1. File: main_scripts/simple_llm_mapper.py

#### Platform Structure (line 84)
```python
# OLD:
'YOUTUBE': {  # DV360 section

# NEW:
'DV360': {  # DV360 section
```

#### Platform Aliases Added (lines 335-339)
```python
self.platform_aliases = {
    'DV360': ['DV360', 'YOUTUBE', 'DISPLAY & VIDEO 360', 'GOOGLE DV360', 'DV 360'],
    'META': ['META', 'FACEBOOK', 'FB', 'INSTAGRAM', 'IG', 'FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM'],
    'TIKTOK': ['TIKTOK', 'TIK TOK', 'TIKTOK ADS', 'TT']
}
```

#### Platform Matching Logic (lines 758-779)
- Removed hardcoded mapping
- Now uses platform_structure keys and checks all aliases
- Handles case-insensitive matching

#### _write_platform_data Method (lines 949-994)
- Removed code that overwrites template headers
- Added platform name writing in column A
- Fixed market header placement with 2-column structure
- Added Planned/Actuals headers for row 24

#### Data Filtering Improvements
- Added debug logging for Source_Type values
- Added fallback for R&F data using UNIQUES_REACH
- Improved error handling for missing columns

## Test Results

### Successful Changes:
- ✅ Platform names appear in column A
- ✅ Headers at correct row 15 (not 16)
- ✅ Market names in correct positions
- ✅ 2-column structure for markets
- ✅ All 3 platforms processed (DV360, META, TIKTOK)
- ✅ 821 cells written successfully

### Remaining Issues:
- ⚠️ Actuals data shows as 0 due to R&F data structure
- ⚠️ Some market data may be incomplete

## Recommendations

1. **R&F Data Structure**: Need to understand how R&F data associates with platforms
2. **Column Mapping**: May need to update column mappings for R&F specific metrics
3. **Data Validation**: Add validation to ensure required columns exist before processing

## Files Modified

1. `main_scripts/simple_llm_mapper.py` - Main fixes implemented
2. Created `test_fixed_mapper.py` - Test script for validation
3. Created multiple documentation files explaining issues and fixes

## Next Steps

1. Clarify R&F data structure with stakeholders
2. Update column mappings if needed for R&F metrics
3. Add more robust error handling for missing data scenarios
4. Consider adding data preview functionality to validate before mapping
