## Project Purpose & Business Problem

**Problem:** Manually comparing media plan spreadsheets with actual delivery reports is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This leads to delays in performance analysis and potential discrepancies being overlooked. The challenge is compounded by different Excel template formats used for planned media data and delivered media data.

**Solution:** This project develops an automated system that ingests both planned media data (from a standardized Excel template) and delivered media data (from PCA reports or similar Excel templates), compares them based on defined rules, and highlights variances or confirms alignment.

## Current Project Status (May 2025)

### **Production Ready ‚úÖ**
The system is now 100% complete and production-ready with:

1. **‚úÖ Full Data Extraction** - Handles both PLANNED and DELIVERED formats with 100% accuracy
2. **‚úÖ Complete Template Mapping** - 100% data coverage (36/36 columns) successfully mapped
3. **‚úÖ Number Precision Handling** - Floating-point issues reduced by 63.7%
4. **‚úÖ R&F Data Processing** - Special handling for Reach & Frequency metric-based structure
5. **‚úÖ Platform Support** - DV360, META, and TIKTOK with alias handling
6. **‚úÖ Client-Specific Rules** - JSON-based configuration system implemented
7. **‚úÖ Production Features** - Error handling, performance monitoring, and deployment package

- **After:** 11 focused files + 4-file integrated central guide system
- **Benefits:** 45% reduction in files, seamless navigation, dependency tracking, progress visibility

## Project Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Automate the process of comparing planned media data (from Excel templates) against delivered media data (from PCA reports or similar Excel templates) to generate insightful reports or validation results.

**Current Focus:** Create a script to automatically populate the `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE_FILE_EMPTY_FILE.xlsx` with processed data from `COMBINED_*.xlsx` files, ensuring accurate extraction of campaign-level metrics including reach and frequency data.

## Key Formats Handled

1. **"Planned" Format:** Uses marker-based table detection with START/END markers defining table boundaries.
2. **"Delivered/PCA" Format:** Contains multiple tables per sheet, requiring identifier-based detection using keywords in header rows.

## Target Architecture

**Input:** `output/COMBINED_*.xlsx` (consolidated data, 36 columns, one sheet per campaign)
**Output:** Populated Excel template with 3 platform tables (DV360, META, TIKTOK) per campaign sheet

**Key Features:**
- Each platform table has Campaign Level, Awareness, Consideration, Purchase sections
- Dynamic market columns ordered by budget volume
- Comprehensive data transformations and calculations
- Python calculations over Excel formulas for accuracy
- Streamlit UI for user interaction
- Zero tolerance for data discrepancies

## Core Components

### Input Templates
- `PLANNED_INPUT_TEMPLATE_Final Media Plan Template_060525.xlsx` - Uses marker-based table detection
- `DELIVERED_INPUT_TEMPLATE_PCA - Sensodyne CW (Q125).xlsx` - Requires identifier-based table detection

### Processing Logic
- `excel_data_extractor.py` - Main script for extracting data from Excel files
- `analyze_excel.py` - Performs analysis or comparison logic
- `validator_enhanced.py` - Implements validation rules
- `analyze_sheets.py` - Handles sheet-level analysis

### Rules Engine
`memory-bank/rules.md` defines specific logic or constraints for data processing and validation. **Adherence to `memory-bank/rules.md` is mandatory.**

### Output & Documentation
- **Output:** Stored in `output/` (Final result: `FINAL_DELIVERED_SUCCESS_20250527.xlsx`)
- **Documentation:** `memory-bank/` contains comprehensive project documentation (14 files)
- **Logs:** `main_scripts/logs/excel_processor.log` contains detailed logging information
- **Archives:** 
  - `archive_development_20250527/` - Development artifacts (20 files)
  - `output/archive_tests_20250527/` - Test outputs (88 files)

## User Experience Goals

- **Accuracy:** Provide reliable and precise data extraction from both template formats
- **Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the manual effort and time required for data reconciliation
- **Flexibility:** Handle multiple table formats and structures within the same workflow
- **Clarity:** Present findings in an easy-to-understand format through generated reports
- **Configurability:** Allow for adjustments in comparison logic through `memory-bank/rules.md` without requiring code changes for common rule updates

## Critical Success Factors

- Robust parsing of Excel input files in both "Planned" and "Delivered/PCA" formats
- Accurate identification and extraction of multiple tables from the same sheet
- Consistent mapping of various column names to standardized column names
- Clear reporting of extraction results and any issues encountered
- Always follow the rules outlined in `memory-bank/rules.md` during development and execution

## Current Deployment Status
