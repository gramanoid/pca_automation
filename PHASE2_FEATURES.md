dashboard = EnhancedValidationDashboard()
dashboard.render_dashboard(validation_results, workflow_data)
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling with Recovery Options

**Location**: `ui_components/error_recovery.py`

**Features**:
- **Intelligent Error Analysis**: Automatically categorizes errors and suggests fixes
- **Recovery Options**:
  - File not found → Find similar files, re-upload, create placeholder
  - Column errors → Auto-map columns, show available columns, skip column
  - Data type errors → Clean data, skip invalid rows, use defaults
  - Permission errors → Use temp directory, fix permissions
  - Memory errors → Enable chunking, clear cache, reduce precision
  - Excel errors → Repair file, convert to CSV
- **Auto-Fix Capabilities**: One-click fixes for common issues
- **Manual Recovery Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for complex issues
- **Error Reporting**: Generate detailed error reports for support

**Usage**:
```python
from ui_components.error_recovery import ErrorRecoveryHandler, with_error_recovery

# As a decorator
@with_error_recovery
def risky_operation():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Or manually
handler = ErrorRecoveryHandler()
handler.render_error_recovery_ui(exception, context)
```

## Integration

The enhanced features are integrated into `streamlit_app_full.py`:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: The `handle_errors` decorator now uses `ErrorRecoveryHandler`
2. **Enhanced Validation Dashboard**: Replaces the basic validation dashboard in Stage 4

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: 
   - Users can understand and fix issues themselves
   - Clear guidance for every error scenario
   - Visual feedback on validation results

2. **Reduced Support Burden**:
   - Automated fixes for common issues
   - Detailed error information for debugging
   - Self-service troubleshooting

3. **Improved Data Quality**:
   - Drill-down to specific data issues
   - Trend analysis to spot patterns
   - Actionable recommendations

## Testing the Features

To test these features:

1. **For Error Recovery**:
   - Try uploading a non-existent file
   - Use a file with wrong column names
   - Process a very large file (memory error)

2. **For Validation Dashboard**:
   - Run validation on your data
   - Click on failed checks to drill down
   - Review recommendations
   - Export validation report

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Email notifications for critical errors
- Integration with ticketing systems
- Machine learning for smarter error predictions
- Historical error analytics
